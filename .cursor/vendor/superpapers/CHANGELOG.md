# Changelog

## [1.5.0] - 2026-06-11

Output-quality hardening driven by recurring defects observed in a generated example paper (margin-overflowing tables, raw code identifiers as table labels, numeric citations under elsarticle, parenthetical abstract, missing Discussion and conceptual framework, audit findings left unfixed). Advisory checklists became blocking gates backed by deterministic scripts.

- New script `compile-latex/scripts/check-log.sh`: post-compile gate that fails on `Overfull \hbox` above 5pt, undefined citations/references, and citation-style mismatches — both statically (elsarticle without the `authoryear` class option, natbib `numbers`, biblatex numeric styles) and in the rendered PDF via `pdftotext`. `compile-latex` Mandatory Step 7 makes it a completion gate; the error table no longer calls `Overfull \hbox` "usually safe to ignore"
- New script `tables-and-figures/scripts/check-tables.sh`: per-table gate that fails on raw code identifiers (underscores outside math mode) in headers/row labels, `\hline`/vertical rules, missing booktabs rules, and notes outside `tablenotes`
- Citation default established plugin-wide: author–year unless the target journal explicitly requires numeric. Anchored in `academic-baseline` principle 3, the paper skeleton, the `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` template (new `Citation style` field), `journal-guidelines` (resolved style recorded; class-option handling for natbib-loading classes like elsarticle; render-verified gate), and `citation-management` (scope note: a clean `.bib` does not fix rendering style)
- `tables-and-figures`: new mandatory label-dictionary step — code identifiers forbidden in tables and figure axes/legends, single dictionary in `code/` (`fixest::etable(dict=)`, `coef_map`, column rename); overflow ladder now starts with font reduction (`\small`/`\footnotesize`, notes `\scriptsize`) before padding, abbreviation, `\resizebox`, landscape; notes must live inside `tablenotes` with reduced font; new anti-overlap figure rules (`ggrepel`, expanded limits, legend outside plot) and a mandatory visual inspection of every figure PDF; post-generation check scripts are completion gates
- `paper-writing`: abstracts must contain zero parenthetical asides (statistics integrated into prose); new Conceptual Framework / Mechanisms section formula, default for empirical papers; Discussion is mandatory (combined Results and Discussion only with recorded justification); new Section Proportions guidance — Results + Discussion are 35–45% of body prose, floors of 1,000/500 words; structural-completeness gate added as Mandatory Step 11
- `templates/paper-skeleton.tex`: standalone Literature Review section replaced by Conceptual Framework (literature review belongs in the Introduction, matching `paper-writing`); Discussion section added before the Conclusion; preamble comment on the `authoryear` class option
- `write-plan`: Writing phase must include Conceptual Framework and Discussion tasks (exclusion requires written justification) and its phase verification now requires `check-log.sh` and `check-tables.sh` to exit 0; Submission phase must include a `paper-review` audit-and-remediate task repeated until a "go" verdict
- `execute-plan`: Stage 1 phase reviews gained blocking checks — `check-tables.sh` plus figure-PDF inspection for any phase producing tables/figures; compile + `check-log.sh` + page-by-page PDF inspection + Discussion/Conceptual Framework presence at the Writing boundary. The pre-submission audit is no longer a non-blocking suggestion: when the plan has a Submission phase, the audit-and-remediate cycle blocks plan completion (escalate after three cycles without "go")
- `paper-review`: new Mandatory Step 12 (remediation cycle with re-audit and recorded waivers); steps 4 and 7 delegate to the new check scripts and require reading figure PDFs; audit rubric gained structural-completeness checks (Discussion Major, conceptual framework Minor, Results+Discussion weight Major, parenthesis-free abstract Minor), a human-readable-labels check (Major), figure overlap check (Major), and a citation-rendering check (Major)

## [1.4.1] - 2026-06-10

Consistency and reliability fixes from a comprehensive plugin review.

- README disclaimer no longer names a specific model; it now recommends the most capable available model with a large context window (1M tokens when available)
- `execute-plan` pre-flight declaration gained an explicit fallback when `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` (or its routing table) is absent: use the plan's `Skills involved` field plus `academic-baseline`
- `paper-review` now explicitly loads `references/audit-rubric.md` — the executable per-dimension checklist with severity criteria — before running audit steps 3–9 (the file existed but was never referenced)
- `templates/CLAUDE.superpapers.md` routing table fixed: Preparation row no longer repeats the always-mandatory `replication-driven-research`; Review row annotated as an optional post-Writing audit outside the 8 canonical plan phases; orphaned rule bullets moved into Instructions for Claude Code
- `brainstorm` gained a guardrail making user answers to Socratic questions binding design inputs — conflicts must be surfaced, never silently overridden
- Command frontmatter `allowed-tools` now includes `Skill` everywhere skills are invoked, `WebFetch`/`WebSearch` for `brainstorm` and `execute-plan`, and `Task` for `execute-plan` subagent dispatch — fewer permission prompts mid-workflow
- `compile.sh` engine detection now recognizes `\usepackage[options]{fontspec}`
- `templates/replication-readme.md` compile instruction no longer points to a plugin-internal script path that does not exist in a distributed replication package; uses `latexmk -pdf -cd paper/paper.tex`
- `templates/paper-skeleton.tex` notes that switching to fontspec/xelatex requires removing `inputenc`, `fontenc`, and `lmodern`
- Typo fixed in panel methods reference: Blundell-Bond (system GMM), not "Blundell-Bover"
- `journal-selection` predatory-journal guidance updated: DOAJ and Think. Check. Submit. (Beall's list is archived and unmaintained)
- CHANGELOG backfilled with the missing 1.3.0 and 1.3.1 entries; 1.0.0 release date corrected to 2026-04-13

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-18

Pre-submission audit skill and command.

- `paper-review` skill added: terminal, cross-cutting pre-submission audit covering numerical consistency (paper prose ↔ tables ↔ logs), narrative coherence (abstract ↔ introduction ↔ results ↔ conclusion), literature dialogue in Results and Discussion, citation integrity, code and reproducibility hygiene (hard-coded paths, seeds, data-loading errors, orphaned scripts), tables and figures quality (booktabs, vector figures, `Overfull \hbox` detection), AI-pattern surface scan including em-dash density, and language consistency
- New command `/superpapers:paper-review` — runs standalone on papers written inside or outside the plugin; produces a persistent audit report at `docs/superpapers/review/audit-YYYYMMDD-HHMM.md` with severity-ranked findings (Critical / Major / Minor) and a go/no-go verdict
- `execute-plan` ends with a non-blocking suggestion to run the new audit before submission; no auto-invocation and no gate on plan completion
- Audit report is written in the paper's declared `paper_language`; remediation is per-finding via AskUserQuestion — never batch-fixed

## [1.3.1] - 2026-04-16

Skill invocation reliability.

- `templates/CLAUDE.superpapers.md` gained a `Skill Routing by Phase` table mapping each canonical research phase to the skills that must be invoked, used as a supplement to (union with) each task's `Skills involved` field
- `execute-plan` now emits a pre-flight declaration before every task — task title, phase, skills from the routing table, skills from the plan, and the union list to invoke — and invokes every skill in the union before doing any task work
- `brainstorm` and `literature-search` wording tightened to keep gap-check mode and full mode clearly separated

## [1.3.0] - 2026-04-15

Universal paper-writing skill.

- `paper-writing` skill added: section formulas (Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Data, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and specialized outputs), style rules with AI-pattern avoidance, research-design narratives for Methods sections, 3-reviewer simulation and 100-point review rubric
- New command `/superpapers:write-paper` — drafts, rewrites, reviews, or audits prose for any section or specialized output (job market paper, grant proposal, policy brief, referee response)
- Writing-phase tasks in plans must include `paper-writing` in `Skills involved`; `execute-plan` runs it in the main session, never in a subagent

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-14

Reliable `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` loading and multi-paper repository support.

- `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` is now reliably loaded by every skill via an explicit walk-up Read on activation (starting from the current working directory and walking up parent directories until found) instead of the previous soft "check for" language that relied on Claude's discretion
- Multi-paper repositories are now supported: place a `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` inside each paper subfolder; skills resolve the correct file based on the current working directory
- `/superpapers:init` repositioned as an opt-in command for advanced users who want to pre-populate settings, pin a reproducibility seed, or add explicit rules; no other command or skill calls or suggests it
- `/superpapers:init` now writes `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` in the current working directory (not the project root) to support multi-paper layouts, and echoes the written content in its summary so same-session skills see it without re-reading disk
- `templates/CLAUDE.superpapers.md` cleaned up: `## Directory Structure` block removed (owned by `replication-driven-research`); `Reproducibility` section removed (seed, version, lockfile were either redundant or better inferred automatically); `Code language` field added to Research Context; target-journal bias and recent-publications rules added to Instructions for Claude Code
- `brainstorm` now explicitly invokes `journal-selection`, `statistical-modeling`, and `data-collection` at the appropriate Socratic steps (publication tier, identification strategy, statistical power, data feasibility), and elevates `replication-driven-research` from a passing guardrail to a foundational step 1 invocation alongside `academic-baseline`
- `write-plan` now includes a canonical `Literature` phase at the start of the pipeline (phases renumbered from 7 to 8); every plan must contain a task that invokes `literature-search` in full mode (all Mandatory Steps, including target-journal bias) to produce a curated bibliography and notes document before data collection begins. `brainstorm` continues to do only the brief gap verification in Step 4 Contribution — the full literature review is an execution-pipeline task, not a brainstorm step
- README documents both single-paper and multi-paper layouts with directory trees

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-13

Strengthened orchestration rules for skill loading and task routing.

- `academic-baseline` is now explicitly invoked first in `brainstorm`, `write-plan`, and `execute-plan`
- `write-plan` now treats `Skills involved` as mandatory routing metadata, with `academic-baseline` required on every task
- `journal-guidelines` is now required for journal-facing tasks, submission formatting, and compliance checks
- `execute-plan` now explicitly honors each task's declared `Skills involved` field during execution
- `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` template and README updated to document the stronger orchestration contract

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-13
