# Execute Plan

## Overview

This skill executes a research plan phase by phase. It starts by invoking `academic-baseline` as the standing policy layer, dispatches subagents for independent tasks, invokes `replication-driven-research` as a guardrail, and runs two-stage review at phase boundaries: correctness first, reproducibility second. It must honor each task's declared `Skills involved` field during execution rather than improvising generic behavior. Stops and asks the user at any scaffolding or destructive action. The skill never proceeds past a phase until both reviews pass.

## When to Use

- A plan exists in `docs/superpapers/plans/`
- User says "execute the plan", "run the plan", or "let's start implementing"
- Transitioning from `write-plan` to implementation
- Resuming execution of a partially-completed plan

## Prerequisites

- An approved plan in `docs/superpapers/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>-plan.md`
- User has explicitly confirmed they want to proceed to execution
- `replication-driven-research` has been invoked at least once in this project (to scaffold directories) or will be invoked as the first step

## Mandatory Steps

1. **Invoke `academic-baseline` first.** This resolves `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` via the walk-up Read (current working directory, then parent directories) and carries its settings into the session. Keep `academic-baseline` active through every phase.

2. **Load and parse the plan.** Read the plan file in full. Extract tasks, phases, dependencies, verification criteria, and `Skills involved`.

3. **Invoke `replication-driven-research` to ensure project structure.** If directories are missing, propose scaffolding. Wait for user confirmation before creating directories or files at the project root.

4. **Pre-flight declaration before every task.** Before executing any task, output a structured block:

   ```
   ## Task: <task title>
   Phase: <phase name>
   Skills (from routing table): <list from CLAUDE.superpapers.md table>
   Skills (from plan): <list from plan's Skills involved field>
   Will invoke: <union of both lists, no duplicates>
   ```

   If `CLAUDE.superpapers.md` is absent or contains no routing table, write `n/a` for the routing-table line and use the plan's `Skills involved` field (plus `academic-baseline`) as the routing source. Invoke every skill in the union list before doing any task work. If `paper-writing` appears, confirm you are in the main session — never dispatch it to a subagent. If `journal-guidelines` appears, confirm the target journal is resolved — if not, invoke `journal-selection` first. If a task is missing a clearly necessary skill, stop and repair the plan before proceeding.

5. **Enforce journal routing.** Any task or review involving a target journal, author instructions, formatting, templates, blinding, cover letters, checklists, or submission portals must invoke `journal-guidelines` before work begins. If the outlet is not fixed yet, invoke `journal-selection` first, then `journal-guidelines`. Never declare journal compliance or submission readiness without this step.

6. **Execute tasks phase by phase.** Within a phase, independent tasks can be dispatched to subagents in parallel. Sequential tasks run in order.

7. **Verify after every task.** Run the task's verification command. If it fails, stop and diagnose — do not proceed silently.

8. **Run end-to-end integration at each phase boundary.** Execute the full pipeline from `data/raw/` to the farthest artifact produced so far. Confirm exit code 0 and that all expected outputs exist.

9. **Two-stage phase review:**
   - **Stage 1 — correctness.** Are the results right? Does the analysis make sense? Narrative review of the outputs, specs, and diagnostics. Stage 1 includes phase-specific blocking checks:
     - Any phase that produced tables or figures (Exploratory, Main Analysis, Robustness, Writing): run `tables-and-figures`' `scripts/check-tables.sh` on `output/tables/` and Read each new figure PDF to check for overlapping annotations, legends, or labels. Both must pass.
     - Writing phase boundary, additionally: (a) compile via `compile-latex`; (b) run its `scripts/check-log.sh` — zero `Overfull \hbox` above tolerance, zero undefined citations or references, citations rendered author–year (or the journal's documented style); (c) Read the compiled PDF and skim every page containing a table or figure to confirm nothing bleeds into the margins or overlaps; (d) confirm the manuscript contains Discussion and Conceptual Framework sections, or that the plan records a justification for their absence.

     **Gate: a phase review does not pass while any of these checks fails.**
   - **Stage 2 — reproducibility.** Is the pipeline clean end-to-end? Is the seed fixed? Is the manifest updated? Use the `replication-driven-research` verification checklist.

10. **Only proceed to the next phase after both stages pass.**

11. **On failure: stop, diagnose root cause, fix, re-run from the failing task.** Never skip failed tasks. Never re-run from scratch without understanding what broke.

12. **Final full-pipeline run.** Before declaring the plan complete, run everything from raw data to final PDF. All verifications must pass.

13. **Report status to the user at phase boundaries.** At the end, summarize what was built, what passed review, and where the artifacts live.

14. **Pre-submission audit.** If the plan contains a Submission phase, the `paper-review` audit-and-remediate task is part of it and **blocks plan completion**: run the audit, remediate every Critical and Major finding (with per-finding user approval as `paper-review` requires; the user may explicitly waive a finding), re-run the audit, and repeat until the verdict is "go". After three cycles without a "go", stop and escalate the remaining findings to the user. If the plan has no Submission phase, recommend `/superpapers:paper-review` as a non-blocking next step after the final summary.

## Subagent Dispatch

Use subagents for:

- Independent collection tasks (different data sources, no shared files)
- Independent robustness checks (different specifications, writing to different files)
- Independent exploratory analyses (different subgroups or variables)

Do NOT use subagents for:

- Sequential tasks where one depends on another's output
- Writing paper sections (context-dependent, needs the main session's understanding of the project; the `paper-writing` skill is invoked in the main session for these tasks)
- Decisions that require user input
- Tasks that touch the same file (git conflicts, clobber risk)

## Guardrails

- **`academic-baseline` is never optional during execution.** If the work is a research task, keep it active.
- **Scaffolding is not automatic.** Always ask the user before creating directories, files, or structure outside the plan.
- **Destructive actions need confirmation.** Never delete data, reset git state, force-push, or overwrite existing artifacts without explicit user approval.
- **Task skill routing is not optional metadata.** Use the plan's `Skills involved` field to decide which superpapers skills are active for a task. Do not freehand domain work with generic reasoning when the plan called for a specific skill.
- **Invalidation on input change is mandatory.** If raw data or a script changes mid-execution, all downstream outputs are stale. Re-run the affected phases — do not patch around the invalidation.
- **No result is final until the pipeline runs end-to-end.** "It worked in my session" is not evidence. Only a clean end-to-end run counts.
- **Journal compliance claims require `journal-guidelines`.** Formatting a manuscript for a named journal, checking a submission checklist, applying blinding rules, or adapting a template without `journal-guidelines` is invalid.
- **Phase-boundary table, figure, and compile checks are not optional.** A failing `check-log.sh` or `check-tables.sh` blocks the phase exactly like a failing task verification.
- **Stop on any verification failure.** Do not mask errors by re-running, ignoring warnings, or adjusting thresholds.

## Anti-Patterns

- Skipping verification between tasks
- Starting execution without invoking `academic-baseline`
- Declaring a phase complete without the end-to-end integration run
- Running tasks out of dependency order
- Silent failures — masking errors to keep moving
- Ignoring a task's `Skills involved` field and improvising the work generically
- Editing downstream outputs when an upstream input changed, without re-running the pipeline
- Parallelizing tasks that share state or touch the same files
- Doing journal-facing work without `journal-guidelines`
- Forgetting to update the manifest or logs
- Skipping user confirmation for scaffolding or destructive actions
- Declaring success without the final full-pipeline run
- Declaring the Writing phase complete without reading the compiled PDF
- Declaring the plan complete with an unresolved no-go audit verdict in the Submission phase

## Verification Before Completion

- [ ] Every task in the plan executed (or explicitly skipped with reason)
- [ ] `academic-baseline` invoked first and kept active during execution
- [ ] Verification command of every task passed
- [ ] Every task executed with the skills declared in `Skills involved`
- [ ] Every phase ended with an end-to-end pipeline run
- [ ] Two-stage review (correctness + reproducibility) completed per phase, including the phase-specific blocking checks (`check-tables.sh`, `check-log.sh`, PDF inspection)
- [ ] Writing phase: compiled PDF was Read page by page for table/figure overflow and overlap; Discussion and Conceptual Framework present or justified
- [ ] Submission phase (when present): `paper-review` audit reached a "go" verdict or remaining findings were explicitly waived by the user
- [ ] Every journal-facing task invoked `journal-guidelines` in the current session
- [ ] Final full-pipeline run exits with code 0
- [ ] `data/manifest.md` up to date with every dataset used
- [ ] `output/logs/` contains the latest execution log
- [ ] All expected outputs exist in `output/tables/`, `output/figures/`, and `paper/`
- [ ] Plan file updated with completion status per task
- [ ] Final commit recorded
