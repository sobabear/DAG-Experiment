# Paper Writing

## Overview

Applies writing discipline to paper prose. Operates under `academic-baseline` — its nine principles bind every step below. Defers non-prose work to sibling skills: `tables-and-figures` for tables and figures, `citation-management` for `.bib` entries, `compile-latex` for LaTeX builds, `replication-driven-research` for reproducibility, `robustness-checks` for which checks to run, `journal-guidelines` for journal-specific formatting.

Deep material lives in `references/`; load a reference file when the task calls for it:

- `section-formulas.md` — structures for Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Data, Results, Discussion, Conclusion, and specialized outputs (JMP, grant, policy brief, referee response).
- `style-rules.md` — sentence structure, phrases to delete, word choice, voice, paragraph discipline, AI-pattern avoidance, five-pass self-check.
- `research-design-narratives.md` — how to write Methods for RCT, DiD, IV, RDD, event study, synthetic control, ML, descriptive, bunching, shift-share, structural.
- `review-checklist.md` — 3-reviewer simulation and 100-point rubric.

## When to Use

- Drafting or rewriting a section of a paper.
- Reviewing or auditing a draft with the 3-reviewer rubric.
- Writing a job market paper, grant proposal, policy brief, op-ed, or referee response.
- Tightening a working paper into a journal version.
- Removing AI-generated writing patterns from a draft.
- Any Writing-phase task dispatched by `execute-plan`.

## Mandatory Steps

1. Invoke `academic-baseline` first. Its walk-up Read loads `CLAUDE.superpapers.md`; the nine principles (especially 4, 8, 9) bind every step below.
2. Identify the task type: drafting, rewriting, reviewing, or specialized output.
3. Identify the paper type from the design spec in `docs/superpapers/specs/` when present: applied empirical, theory, mixed, structural, or descriptive. Ask the user if absent.
4. Identify the target section; load the matching formula from `references/section-formulas.md`. For Methods sections, also load `research-design-narratives.md`.
5. Apply the seven core principles below.
6. Apply the style rules in `references/style-rules.md`. Run the five-pass self-check before declaring the output done.
7. Mark author-input gaps with `[AUTHOR: description]`. Never invent numbers, citations, dataset names, institutional details, or dates.
8. Use causal language only when the design supports it; otherwise correlational. (Academic-baseline principle 4.)
9. Produce output in `paper_language` from `CLAUDE.superpapers.md`. (Academic-baseline principle 8.)
10. Defer non-prose work to the sibling skills listed in the Overview.
11. **Enforce structural completeness for empirical papers.** The paper must contain a Discussion section (or an explicitly justified combined Results and Discussion) and a Conceptual Framework / mechanisms section by default; the Abstract must contain no parenthetical asides; Results + Discussion must carry the weight prescribed by the Section Proportions in `references/section-formulas.md`. **Gate: do not declare a full-paper draft or a Writing-phase task complete while any of these is missing without a justification recorded to the user.**

## The Seven Core Principles

1. **Reader First.** Write for PhD-level researchers in your discipline, not subfield specialists. Readers skim; make it easy to find the basic result fast.
2. **Triangular Style.** Most important information first, then details. No punchline endings.
3. **One Central Contribution.** State it in a paragraph. Every piece of the paper serves this one contribution.
4. **Concrete.** Say what you find, with magnitudes. "A 10% increase in X reduces Y by 3 percentage points (SE = 0.8)", not "I find interesting effects".
5. **Every Word Counts.** Cut ruthlessly. Target 30–45 pages (adapt to field and journal).
6. **Active Voice, Present Tense.** "I find…", "Smith (2019) finds…". Passive acceptable in methods descriptions and captions only.
7. **Simple > Complex.** "Use" not "utilize". "But" not "however". Simpler estimation is better than complex for the same identification.

## Field Adaptation

Read `field` from `CLAUDE.superpapers.md`:

- Economics, political science, public administration: apply all rules directly.
- Epidemiology, public health, medicine: follow CONSORT for RCTs, STROBE for observational studies; pre-registration norms (ClinicalTrials.gov, PROSPERO); defer to ICMJE via `journal-guidelines`.
- Sociology, education, psychology: some field journals expect a standalone Literature Review section; adapt the introduction formula to the target journal.
- Other fields: apply the seven principles and formulas; consult the user when a convention should override.

If `field` is unset, ask the user inline before applying field-specific advice.

## Anti-Patterns

- Inventing coefficients, sample sizes, F-statistics, hazard ratios, citations, or institutional details. Mark gaps with `[AUTHOR: …]`.
- Producing output in English when `paper_language` is another language.
- Throat-clearing openings: "It is important to note that…", "Researchers have long wondered…", "The literature has long been interested in…".
- Burying the lead. The main result must appear by paragraph 3 of the introduction.
- Literature review written as an annotated bibliography ("Smith found X. Jones found Y.") rather than a story with a "however".
- Literature review placed as a separate section when the journal expects it integrated into the introduction.
- Passive voice as the default in body prose. (Acceptable only in methods descriptions and captions.)
- Adjectives describing the author's own work: "striking", "novel", "important contribution".
- Causal language without an identification strategy.
- Excessive subsections, or parentheses / em-dashes used as a crutch. (Academic-baseline principle 9.)
- A separate "Limitations" subsection in the conclusion. Limitations belong near the analysis they qualify.
- Conclusion that copy-pastes the abstract or introduction. Each phrases the same findings differently.
- Declaring output done without running the five-pass self-check from `references/style-rules.md`.
- Replicating content already in sibling skills (tables, figures, `.bib`, LaTeX commands, replication standards).
- Abstract with parenthetical statistics — integrate them into the prose.
- Ending the paper at Results (or Robustness) + Conclusion with no Discussion.
- Results section that only narrates table values, without magnitudes, mechanisms, or dialogue with the literature.
- Skipping the Conceptual Framework section without recording a justification.

## Verification Before Completion
