## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.6] - 2026-08-10

### Changed

- Bumped the plugin from 1.1.5 to 1.1.6 so the latest skill-content updates
  are delivered to installed clients.

## [1.1.5] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- A reader-accessibility gate for nonessential field shorthand and umbrella
  labels that obscure an otherwise simple claim.
- Context-sensitive diagnostics for sentence-opening `Beyond X,` frames and
  indirect uses of `draw on`, with direct wording retained as the default when
  no meaning would be lost.
- Regression coverage distinguishing the flagged templates from a direct
  subject–verb sentence.

## [1.1.4] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- A six-part functional prose and citation audit covering transitions,
  function-preserving concision, natural scholarly syntax, claim–citation
  alignment, observable stock patterns, and dash/hyphen style.
- A project-profile check for established open compounds so exact-candidate
  audits can flag forms such as `disaster-management` when the registered
  convention is `disaster management`.
- Regression coverage for scholarly abbreviations, demonstrative openings,
  short transition-led sentences, suspended compounds, dense hyphenation, and
  registered open compounds.
- A literature-synthesis gate that orders examples by an explicit evidentiary
  logic, with broad context to the closest precedent and gap as the default
  when it fits the paragraph's function.

### Changed

- Paragraph-boundary checks now require the closing bridge to identify which
  research questions or objectives it prepares.
- Bumped the plugin from 1.1.3 to 1.1.4 so the functional prose and open-compound
  checks are delivered to installed clients.

## [1.1.3] - 2026-08-10

### Added

- An exact-candidate audit that checks the final proposed passage against the
  active project's terminology, forbidden variants, and discouraged prose
  patterns, and records the candidate hash.
- Regression coverage for candidate rewrites, legacy terminology registries,
  accepted-view DOCX extraction, and Word comment-reply linkage.

### Changed

- Lightweight edits now retain a mandatory post-rewrite candidate gate; any
  later wording change invalidates the earlier result.
- Text consistency audits accept legacy `avoid` terminology fields, apply
  token-aware matching, exclude deleted Word text and comments, and block
  non-auditable semantic-lock schemas instead of silently passing them.
- DOCX structure reports now include revision, comment, and reply authors plus
  orphaned reply-parent identifiers.
- Bumped the plugin from 1.1.2 to 1.1.3 so the exact-candidate audit and related
  integrity fixes are delivered to installed clients.

## [1.1.2] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- Reframed the bilingual README around the complete manuscript lifecycle, from
  research framing and argument architecture through extended outlining,
  evidence-led drafting, bidirectional alignment, four-pass top-to-bottom
  review, revision propagation, and exact-package verification.
- Documented compatibility with ChatGPT, Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes
  Agent, and other clients that implement the open Agent Skills format.
- Replaced client-specific skill invocation prefixes in user-facing prompts and
  interface defaults with portable natural-language skill names.
- Bumped the plugin from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 so the updated interface defaults are
  delivered to installed clients.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- A selectively loaded display, notation, and provenance module with an
  equation-symbol ledger and an end-to-end trace for derived figure and table
  quantities.
- Routing and boundary evals for derived displays, simple descriptive displays,
  and comment replies that are not verified by the current artifacts.

### Changed

- Cross-round review now separates reviewer instructions, author replies, and
  changes verified in the active manuscript and companion files.
- A resolved comment thread or response-letter claim no longer establishes
  `RESOLVED` without current-artifact evidence.
- Bumped the plugin from 1.1.0 to 1.1.1.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- An explicit extended-outline and paragraph-contract workflow linking function,
  claim, evidence, development, and paragraph-to-paragraph bridges.
- A project style profile for language variant, protected technical terms,
  allowed repetition, and discouraged phrases.
- `audit_prose_patterns.py` for deterministic diagnostics of exact duplication,
  repeated sentence openings and multiword phrases, stock phrasing, and
  candidate nontechnical word overuse.
- Progressive `paper-review` references for psychometrics and SEM; AI, LLM,
  ABM, and computational studies; water, CNHS, policy, and uncertainty; and
  flood, hydrodynamics, and catastrophe modeling.
- Routing and boundary evals for hybrid module selection, material ambiguity,
  neutral domain review, explicit Ethan-style composition, and cross-round
  evidence limits.

### Changed

- Generalized `paper-review` into a cross-disciplinary reviewer orchestrator
  that infers the smallest sufficient module set from the conversation and
  manuscript.
- Made Ethan-style review and named lab-project precedents explicit-only
  overlays instead of default behavior for water or modeling papers.
- Expanded the full review pass to separate necessary technical repetition from
  avoidable prose repetition and to assess observable formulaic patterns
  without inferring AI authorship.
- Bumped the plugin from 1.0.0 to 1.1.0.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added

- A managed-project workflow with authority sources, semantic locks, fact and
  terminology registries, question-to-evidence alignment, issue status,
  release candidates, and exact-artifact checks.
- Study-design adapters for quantitative, experimental, qualitative, mixed,
  computational, AI/LLM, evidence-synthesis, theoretical, framework, methods,
  and data papers.
- Deterministic audits for manuscript state, text consistency, Word OOXML
  structure, and regression cases.
- A mandatory functional-completeness retrospective after every review,
  revision, audit, or release check.
- The separate `paper-review` skill, implemented as an evidence-safe
  Ethan-style water, CNHS, ABM, flood/hydrodynamics, uncertainty, and AI review
  overlay.

### Changed

- Rebuilt `academic-writing-skills` around the full manuscript lifecycle,
  bidirectional evidence alignment, change-impact classes, negative-space
  review, and blocking release gates.
- Separated universal integrity, study-design checks, domain conventions,
  reviewer preferences, venue requirements, and project-specific state.
- Replaced fixed IMRAD and section-template assumptions with reader-function
  routing across manuscript archetypes.
- Replaced unsupported “explain why” requirements with evidence-calibrated
  mechanism and interpretation rules.
- Bumped the plugin from 0.3.3 to 1.0.0 because the architecture and bundled
  skill set changed materially.

### Removed

- Legacy style checklists and fixed templates that duplicated the new
  lifecycle core or promoted project and reviewer preferences to universal
  rules.

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- A mandatory comprehensive-manuscript review for top-to-bottom,
  paper-ready, and final-release requests. The workflow records evidence while
  moving from document structure through headings, sections, paragraphs,
  sentences, terminology, displays, and evidence provenance, then repeats the
  review in reverse after editing.
- Explicit gates for orphan text between parent headings and subsections,
  author-specified paragraph counts, conceptual sentence and paragraph
  handoffs, sentence necessity, standalone-artifact abbreviations, and model
  display names versus technical identifiers.
- Rendered page-break semantics for continued tables and a reproducibility
  provenance gate for runtime, token, cost, call-count, and hardware records.
- Two behavioral evals covering hierarchical manuscript review and
  supplementary-table pagination with suspicious duplicate workload values.

### Changed

- Submission reporting now separates technical paper-ready,
  author-action-required, and fully submission-ready states.
- Plugin version bumped from `0.3.2` to `0.3.3`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added

- A reader-encounter-order rule that introduces the purpose and object of an
  assessment before its criteria or metrics, and requires source labels to
  match the actual provenance scope.
- A statistic-claim alignment gate that separates visual observations,
  descriptive summaries, and inferential claims and matches each claim to the
  estimand and hypothesis tested.
- Conditional measurement-model checks for studies using latent variables or
  multi-question measures.
- Bidirectional main-text and supplementary-material checks, removal of
  drafting scaffolds, cross-artifact invariant checks, and submission-package
  rebuild verification.
- Figure-placement and embedded-versus-standalone figure synchronization
  checks.
- Two behavioral evals covering reader order and statistic-claim alignment,
  and cross-artifact submission integrity.

### Changed

- Plugin version bumped from `0.3.1` to `0.3.2`.
- The new rules are field-agnostic and store no paper-, journal-, sample-, or
  template-specific values.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-21

### Added

- `references/results_writing.md`: a Results-specific workflow for selecting
  the current evidence baseline, organizing prose around patterns rather than
  inventories, avoiding Methods duplication, grounding each number in the
  source actually cited, and distinguishing descriptive, within-group, and
  formal between-group comparisons.
- Two behavioral evals covering reader-visible evidence and subgroup
  comparison boundaries.

### Changed

- Results guidance now uses `main pattern -> selective evidence -> result-level
  synthesis` as the default arc. A mechanism is included only when directly
  supported, preventing descriptive or associational findings from acquiring
  invented causal explanations.
- Figure-text and claim-evidence audits now check authoritative artifact
  versions, reader-visible support, exact source attribution, sample counts,
  model names, and run counts in both directions.
- Plugin version bumped from `0.3.0` to `0.3.1` so marketplace installs receive
  the updated skill content.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-30

Calibrated the skill against a corpus of a water-resources advisor group's own
published papers (the corpus analysis is kept private to the maintainer). The
rules below were verified against that corpus and passed a multi-angle
adversarial gate (contradiction, corpus-faithfulness, dogfooding, anonymization,
cross-reference, apply-time usability) followed by a skeptic adjudication pass.
All additions are field-agnostic; group-specific values belong in
`.paper/style_overrides.md`.

### Added

- **Study Area section checklist** in `references/section_checklists.md` (the
  skill previously had none): a four-move funnel (name-and-quantify or a
  first-person testbed selection, stakes via a "However" pivot, an optional
  institutional or legal layer, and a mandatory testbed justification),
  two-layer hedging, a justify-every-choice lint, and an explicit carve-out
  that the abstract "no study area first" rule does not apply here.
- **§1.9 Paragraph-To-Question Alignment** in
  `references/writing_principles.md`: align Introduction review paragraphs,
  Results threads, and Conclusion findings to the research sub-questions
  (P2 to SQ1, P3 to SQ2), stated as a default to aim for rather than a rigid
  rule.
- **`references/style_overrides_customization.md`**: a generic template for
  calibrating a group's own overrides (a corpus-measurement recipe, a
  field-native word allow-list, the universal stock-phrase hard-flag list, an
  em-dash budget method, and per-section prompts). Registered in the integrity
  test manifest.
- Introduction, Abstract, Results, Discussion, and Conclusion checklist items
  for the patterns the corpus surfaced: reporting frames, who/where/time in the
  abstract WHERE, an optional forward-looking closer, figure-first Results
  openings, an opt-in certainty-grading ladder and validation-before-projection,
  a mandatory enumerated Limitations-and-future-work subsection, and a
  conclusion that mirrors the introduction's numbered objectives with a
  capability-phrased generalizability sentence.

### Changed

- **§1.1 Findings First** now scopes its figure-first ban to the abstract and
  finding-density prose, and permits a figure-first callout in Results when the
  finding's magnitude and its mechanism follow immediately in the same
  paragraph.
- **§2.1 No Overclaim** exempts the neutral reporting frame "the results
  show/showed that ..." (the hedge lives on the interpretation that follows,
  not on the frame). An unhedged causal or predictive verb after the frame
  still trips the overclaim and causal-claim audits.
- **`references/banned_words.md`**: a new Field-Native Exemptions subsection
  turns field-native words ("robust", "comprehensive", "facilitate") into a
  density check rather than a per-occurrence ban; "novel"/"first" are
  permitted-but-hedged in body sections when fenced by "to the best of our
  knowledge" and routed to a priority check, and stay banned in the abstract.
  The §6 overclaim table and the em-dash rule cross-reference the exemptions.
- Directional expectations in the Introduction are now optional rather than
  expected, and grand-narrative openers are discouraged.

### Notes

- Anonymization: a pre-existing advisor-group name in
  `references/writing_principles.md` §4.4 was generalized to "some advisor
  groups"; no advisor, paper, or basin is named anywhere in the skill.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-06-14

### Added

- **§4.10 "Each Paragraph Hands Off To The Next"** in
  `references/writing_principles.md`: a paragraph's final sentence must set up
  the next paragraph (a consequence, limitation, or open question it raises), so
  the reader feels the next question coming. Forbids both dead-stop endings and
  connective-only bridges (a "However," bolted on the start of the next
  paragraph in place of a real handoff). Complements §4.5 (transitions as a
  post-structure polish step) and §4.8 (plain, not ornate).

## [0.2.3] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **§1.8 "Results Answers The Questions; Discussion Extends Beyond Them"** in
  `skills/academic-writing-skills/references/writing_principles.md`, plus a
  matching Discussion checklist line in `references/section_checklists.md`
  (plugin `0.2.2 -> 0.2.3`). Makes the Results/Discussion boundary explicit:
  Results answers the research questions (finding -> mechanism -> question);
  the Discussion extends beyond them (cross-result synthesis, boundary,
  positioning, implications, limitations) and is not a paragraph-by-paragraph
  re-answer (that 1:1 mapping is the Conclusion's job). The skill already
  encoded the anti-restate spirit; this adds the explicit "beyond the
  questions" framing.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **§1.7 "Emphasis In The Subject (End-Focus)"** in
  `skills/academic-writing-skills/references/writing_principles.md`
  (plugin `0.2.1 → 0.2.2`). Adds a sentence-level rule to §1 (Structure
  And Logic): put the main point in the grammatical subject and main
  clause, relegate secondary information (time, place, method genealogy,
  hedges) to subordinate clauses with the heaviest/newest material at the
  end (end-weight), and never split the subject from its verb with a
  time/place adverbial. Extends §1.1 (findings first) to the sentence
  level. The principle was already carried in downstream copies
  (`~/.claude/ACADEMIC_WRITING.md`, the 0.2.0 plugin cache); committing it
  to source so it survives plugin re-sync from `@main`.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-23

### Fixed

- **`claim_evidence_audit.md` is now schema-aware of `.paper/claims.yml`**
  (`skills/academic-writing-skills/references/claim_evidence_audit.md`,
  plugin `0.2.0 → 0.2.1`). Cross-plugin friction surfaced by Stage 7-8
  dogfood (`~/.claude/audits/dogfood_runs/2026-05-23-paper-memory-academic-writing-stage-7-8/VERIFICATION.md`
  F-cross1): SKILL.md prominently says *"When `.paper/claims.yml` and
  `.paper/figures.yml` exist (produced by `paper-memory-builder`),
  use them as ground truth instead of re-reading the manuscript"* —
  but `claim_evidence_audit.md`, the actual workflow doc, had **zero
  mentions** of any schema field (`evidence_artifacts`, `status`,
  `risk`, `sentence_in_manuscript`, `figures[].supports_claims`).
  An agent walking the audit doc had to either re-read the manuscript
  (defeating the contract) or guess how to map the YAML.
  - Adds a new `## When .paper/claims.yml is present (schema-aware
    audit, v0.2.1+)` section that maps each schema field to an
    audit-table column.
  - Documents the **status → certainty allowed** mapping:
    `supported` → direct verbs OK; `draft` → hedged verbs only;
    `gap` → NONE, must apply Disposition (1-5).
  - Documents **status transitions during audit** (e.g. `gap → draft`
    when Disposition 5 adds evidence; `draft → supported` when audit
    confirms wording matches evidence strength) so changes can be
    recorded in `.paper/revision_history.yml`.
  - Documents the **figures.yml cross-check** — every claim with
    `figure_or_table` entries should appear in the corresponding
    `figures[].supports_claims` list; mismatches flag for
    `paper-memory-builder` refresh.
  - Includes schema-aware audit pseudocode showing how to walk
    `claims.yml` while enforcing the anti-leakage rule.
  - Same shape of fix as the v0.3.13 (PR #97) F1 fix on the
    `research-context-compressor` Output spec (consumer-side
    workflow doc gains schema awareness so the producer-side
    contract is operational at workflow level).
  - Pure additive prose change to one reference file — no schema
    changes, no SKILL.md edits, no behaviour change for users
    auditing without a `.paper/claims.yml` present (they still
    follow the legacy generic-audit workflow above).

### Added

- **CI `skill-version-guard` job** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).
  Blocks a PR that changes `skills/` content without also bumping
  `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `version`. The marketplace plugin
  cache is keyed on the version string, so an un-bumped skill change
  ships to `main` but never reaches user installs. The `0.2.0`
  release itself was a fix for exactly this — the `§8 step 10`
  change had merged without a version bump (dogfood finding V1b).
  This guard makes that a hard CI failure at PR time. Workflow-only
  change; no plugin version bump needed (the guard does not fire on
  `.github/` edits).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added

- `.github/workflows/test.yml` — runs `python -m pytest tests/ -q` on
  push + PR to `main`.

### Changed

- **Plugin version `0.1.0` → `0.2.0`** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`).
  Required so the §8 step-10 change below actually reaches user
  installs: the marketplace plugin cache directory is keyed on this
  version string. A 2026-05-21 Phase 9 behavioral verification found
  step 10 was correct on `main` but absent from the cached `0.1.0`
  bundle — the change had shipped to the repo but not to installs.
  Bumping the version forces a fresh cache directory on
  `claude plugin update academic-writing-skills@ai-research-skills`.
- **§8 Self-Audit gains a mandatory claim-gap cross-reference (step 10).**
  The 2026-05-20 `ai-research-skills` dogfood found a real gap: a
  banned-word / overclaim audit could pass a sentence as
  linguistically clean while that sentence asserted a claim the
  `paper-memory-builder` memory layer recorded as `status: gap`
  (unevidenced). The skill consumed `.paper/claims.yml` as a context
  *source* (§4) but never cross-referenced audited prose against the
  `gap` status. Step 10 now makes it mandatory: every assertive
  sentence mapping to a `status: gap` claim must be flagged
  `[MATERIAL GAP]`, on overclaim / banned-word / claim-evidence
  audits alike — a clean-prose verdict never overrides a `gap`
  finding. Step 10 carries an inline `claims.yml` row-schema note
  (`id` / `text` / `status` one of `draft | supported | rejected |
  gap`) so a session that has not loaded `paper-memory-builder` can
  still execute it, plus an "assertive sentence" heuristic. Closes
  the dogfood C2 PARTIAL finding for audits orchestrated through
  `SKILL.md` §8 — a future caller that runs a banned-word pass as a
  standalone subagent without loading `SKILL.md` is out of this
  step's reach.
- **Frontmatter description surfaces the `paper-memory-builder`
  upstream-dep ordering hint.** Body text already explained the
  contract ("if `.paper/claims.yml` exists, prefer it; refresh via
  paper-memory-builder if changed", lines 96-100) and
  `WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills/CONTRIBUTING.md` §2 documents the
  cross-skill artifact contract — but the frontmatter `description`
  field never mentioned it. Auto-trigger by Claude Code routes via
  description-keyword matching, so the trigger-time hint to consider
  running `paper-memory-builder` first for multi-section /
  claim-evidence / reviewer-response work was missing. Closes the
  D6 / Phase 2 Item #6 gap surfaced by the `ai-research-skills`
  Task #27 dogfood walk.

### Fixed

- `tests/test_skill_integrity.py` — pre-existing bug: tests pointed at
  `ROOT / "SKILL.md"` and `ROOT / "references/..."`, but the
  2026-04-26 marketplace migration (commit
  [`fca3dc7`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/academic-writing-skills/commit/fca3dc7))
  moved both under `skills/academic-writing-skills/`. Tests had never
  run in CI (none was configured) so the breakage was silent. Updated
  to use `SKILL_DIR = ROOT / "skills" / "academic-writing-skills"`.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-13

The initial published version. Captures the skill as it stood at
commit [`a04dee7`](https://github.com/WenyuChiou/academic-writing-skills/commit/a04dee7)
("Strengthen skill with 6 audit-driven additions"), the HEAD on
`main` when this CHANGELOG was first added.

### Included

- `SKILL.md` — Claude Code skill manifest with frontmatter + the
  full academic writing workflow (manuscript revision pipeline,
  banned-word + humanise pass, claim-evidence audit, journal-format
  check, reviewer response).
- `references/` — reference files for §4.x writing principles
  (no invented compound terms, colon/semicolon limits, domain-native
  vocabulary, …).
- `tests/test_skill_integrity.py` — pytest covering frontmatter
  validity, required-files presence, mojibake checks, eval shape,
  and bilingual README cross-reference.
- Bilingual `README.md` + `README.zh-TW.md`.
- `LICENSE` (MIT).
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` so the root SKILL.md is picked up by
  the `WenyuChiou/ai-research-skills` marketplace.

### Known limitations (as of 0.1.0)

- No GitHub Actions CI yet — pytest is run locally before each
  commit. (CI added in [0.2.0] above.)
- Tested by one graduate-student researcher; not corpus-scale
  validated.
- Domain lean: water-resources / agent-based modeling phrasing
  conventions surface in some references; the core workflow is
  domain-neutral.
